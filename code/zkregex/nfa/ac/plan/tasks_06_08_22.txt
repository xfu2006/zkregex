Plan Week 06/09/2022
--------------------------------------
Our final goal is to answer the following questions:
(1) does AC signature has FALSE POSITIVE? (report virus for GOOD files)
(2) does AC signature has FALSE NEGATIVE? (report NO virus for BAD files)
This eventually will be tested in ACTest.java and ACFastTest.java
(testGood/BadFiles operations). 

We will design and factor the job into the following tasks:

T1. collect sample VIRUS files
	In nfa/ac/data/clamav/source/main.ndb (we have all virus hex signatures)
	e.g., Win.Trojan.Parite-1.0 .......
	Need to find 3 REAL viruses in the last and save them into:
	*** nfa/ac/data/real_virus ***
	TO avoid files being removed when people download, 7z 
	the file with password "abc123" (see post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28160254/7-zip-command-to-create-and-extract-a-password-protected-zip-file-on-windows) 

T2. collect sample SIMULATED VIRUS
	In case T1 does not work, we can collect 3 sample executables 
	from /usr/bin and put them in folder
	*** nfa/ac/data/simulated_virus/src ***
	Finish extract_sig.py to generate signatures for them
	check: https://blog.adamsweet.org/?p=250

T3. Provide a scan() function in AC
	1. in ac/src/...../Tools.java implement the following utility function
		[a] toAbsolutePath
		[b] getFiles
	2. in ac/src/..../AC.java implement the following functions
		[a] isVirus(filename)
		[b] listViruses(dirname)
