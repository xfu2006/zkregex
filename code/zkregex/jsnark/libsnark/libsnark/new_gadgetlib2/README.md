//! Basic idea: all major classes and functions are parameterized/templated
//! by the FieldType instead of binding directly to ec_pp

//! NOTE: due to c++ template instantion constraints.
//! include the .hpp file and make sure that it's included
//! in ONE and ONLY ONE compilation units! (see genr1cs_interface)
//! as one example
