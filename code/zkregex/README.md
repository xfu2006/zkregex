Practical Zero-Knowledge Proof for Regular Expressions

Major Components:
* Jsnark: it has additionao circuits for extracting hash and
	Speck encryption of the information flow.
* Dizk: additional module added for executing R1CS and proof gen
* Acc: bilinear accmulator module that handles multi-set operations
